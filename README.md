# About Me
Hi, my name is Lara Haase, and I use she/her pronouns, but am happy with they/them as well. I'm a graduate student at CMU studying Public Policy & Management - Data Analytics. My undergraduate degrees were in Photojournalism and Psychology. After college I tried many different jobs: 
- neuroscience research assistant
- early childhood teacher
- intake specialist for abuse & neglect reporting
- Algebra tutor 
- substitute teacher
- wedding photographer
- circus performance artist (stilt-walking being the most lucrative)

Eventually I decided if I wanted to have job security/stability I needed to learn computer programming. Once I started the basic of programming, I learned about Data Science and realize it was the perfect tool that played to my analytical strengths and would also impower me to impact the world as I imagine for my career. After a data science bootcamp, I worked for a small consulting firm, but it became clear after a bit that our mutual needs were mismatched, so I headed off to CMU. After graduation I hope to use my data skills to either work in federal government, or work in a consulting firm or think tank focus on issues around government.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to become a better communicator through digital medium from this course. I thought I was decent at writing and creating data visualizations, but a negative experience with blog-post writing in my previous job helped pushed me towards entering my current graduate program at CMU. It seems I had/have lots to learn not just about creating visualizations, but also telling stories with data. I'm a little worried that this class won't address writing skills in the ways I was hoping, but I believe the final project should offer some opportunity for practice there.
