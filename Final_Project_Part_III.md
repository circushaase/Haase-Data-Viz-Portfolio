# The Idea
Part I of this process was creating the idea and finding the data. Follow that piece of the process [here](Final_Project_Part_I.md).

# Storyboarding, Wireframes and User Feedback
Part II consisted of creating a layout of the story, with some mock-up charts (wireframes). Then I interviewed three users to get feedback and understand the user's experience. Read details about how I moved through that process [here](/Final_Project_Part_II.md).

# The Final Draft
To begin this step of the process, I had to wrangle my data, create my digital visualizations, and incorporate user feedback. The data turned out to be way messier than I expected, so I took a long time just digging through the USDA:NASS's "Quick Stats" tool. I even had to email for help because I couldn't find the simple totals of US farms before 1997. Their customer service actually responded fairly promptly, within a busniess day or two. With practice, I was able to get a grasp on their site and data tool, but the organization of the data is non-intuitive, and sometime the data I found did not match up with other sources and even USDA reports. 

I used Flourish to create most of my visualizations because it is so quick and easy to use. There were some raod bumps in formatting some aspects to git the Shorthand form, but once I figured it all out I just stuck with Flourish because I didn't have time to try to relearn another tool. I do wish I had had more time to create visualizations, as I had a couple ideas that would have been more engaging (such as making my CAFO bar chart into an infographic with clipart animals). I think te breadth I was trying to cover in my story just didn't allow me to spend the time and care I would have liked on more creative visuals. Instead, I think the fact the the graph I do use are basic and simple helps keep the reader from getting too confused or distracted, and conveys the message quickly, allowing the reader to move on to the next point. 

## User Research
Results from my user research let me know that I was reaching the intended audience (a general adult audience), but that there were also some clunky bits about the story and the flow that needed to be cleaned up. Adding in the written part of the story was really helpful to create the flow of the story between charts, and also allowed me to squeeze in additional information and resources that I couldn't fit into the charts. 

Specifically, the introduction to my story changed quite a bit. The mock-ups I'd done pointed toward the types of crops and agricultural exports that the US had, which interested my readers, but was confusing as it is not the main point of the story. I wanted my readers to know that this story is about the domestic agriculture industry, not the international one, so I removed these charts, and instead created one that displayed the source of domestic crops. There is still a link to an external resource in the body text that gets more into the US food system and what crops are exported, etc., but it is for the curious reader, and not the first thing seen that distracts all readers. 

In general I was about to adjust some of the awkward parts of the layout in Shorthand. Getting the charts into a digital form was really the key there. Being able to directly insert html embedding from Flourish was very helpful and made it much easier to deal with cut off visualizations and other layout issues that I (and other students) had been grappling with. User feedback also helped me realize I could remove some Shorthand features that were distracting and not adding to the story (like titles floating across the images).

I wish I could have incorporated the user recommendation to put "helping farm workers" as another Call to Action, but I just didn't have the time and resources, much less the space, to include it.
