# People Who Grow Our Food
## How the US agriculture industry has shifted, its causes and effects, and what we can do

### Summary
The number of farms in the United States peaked in [1935, at 6.8 million](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/farming-and-farm-income/), then declined steeply until the 1970s, and has been decreasing moderately ever since. As the share of employment in agriculture has dropped, Americans increasingly do not know where their food comes from, and suffer from diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. This project examines the changing demographics of farmers in the US and how our food has changed with them.

### Data
The USDA conducts the [Census of Agriculture](https://www.nass.usda.gov/AgCensus/index.php) every five years, to count US farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Aggregate statistics are available at a county, state and national level. I plan to use state level aggregates to compare the demographics of farms and farm operators across US states, as well as over time.
The data is available to explore and download publicly through this site https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/ and can be downloaded in full via ftp [here](ftp://ftp.nass.usda.gov/quickstats/).
I may supplement my story with additional data sources such as [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/1126/us-agriculture/) where needed.

### Outline
Story Arc:
![Arc of the Story](/story_arc.jpg)

My intro will start with basic statistics on the current state of US Agriculture, it's place within the US economy, and the world, as well as the current demographics of US farms and farmers. 
The story will then progress to the shift from the height in the number of farms in 1935, to the changing nature of agriculture, increased mechanization and productivity that led to a drop in number of farms. 
Then I'll move into the consequences of this change, such as damaging enironmental impacts, corporatization of farms, and the change in burden to farmers (ie: increased opportunity costs, effects of glyphosate, cost of heavy machinary needed to compete). May add additional data/info about the rural t urban migration, as well as link to other resources that talk about why these shifts happened, etc.
The low of the story will focused on the externalized costs of these changes: increases in diet-related chronic diseases, urban children unaware of the sources of food, etc
An increased interest in local foods, vegetarianism, farmers' markets and food sourcing in general since about 2000 will bring the story arc back up from its low. If there is time/space, I will talk about joint programs between SNAP and farmers' markets (but also point out the gaps in such programs).
The approval of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 and increased international cooperation will bring the story to a more positive note, and then point the reader to the **Call to Action:**
- How to contact your government representative and ask them to support legislation that promotes the SDGs, SNAP/food access, and local food initiatives
- (links to resources? for) How to read labels and learn where the food you buy is sourced from
- Find a Farmers' Market, and how to contact your local grocer to ask for more local/sustainable products and to display source information
- Links to other resources with information on SDG performance of food brands
- Resources to find/support local agriculture/food organizations (ie: Food policy councils)
