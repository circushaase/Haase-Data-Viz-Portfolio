# People Who Grow Our Food
## How the US agriculture industry has shifted, its causes and effects, and what we can do

### Summary
The number of farms in the United States peaked in [1935, at 6.8 million](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/farming-and-farm-income/), then declined steeply until the 1970s, and has been decreasing moderately ever since. As the share of employment in agriculture has dropped, Americans increasingly do not know where their food comes from, and suffer from diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. This project examines the changing demographics of farmers in the US and how our food has changed with them.

### The Data
The USDA conducts the [Census of Agriculture](https://www.nass.usda.gov/AgCensus/index.php) every five years, to count US farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Aggregate statistics are available at a county, state and national level. I plan to use state level aggregates to compare the demographics of farms and farm operators across US states, as well as over time.
The data is available to explore and download publicly through this site https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/ and can be downloaded in full via ftp [here](ftp://ftp.nass.usda.gov/quickstats/).
I may supplement my story with additional data sources such as [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/1126/us-agriculture/) where needed.
