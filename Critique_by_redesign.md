# Critique by Redesign

I chose to critique a chart by Our World in Data, which is the first visualization in an [article about the environmental impact of food production.] (https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food). Here's the image for reference:

I chose this chart because my major policy interests are focused on food access, distribution, and agriculture. I'm particularly interested in sustainable food systems, and so I have been trying to learn about the current effects of agriculture on the environment. I came across this blog post and briefly skimmed it while working on a previous project analyzing nutrition versus environmental impact. I welcomed the opportunity to dig into it deeper. In this second review, I was a bit surprised to notice that a site devoted to data analysis writing created a visualization that was so unappealing, overwhelming and bit confusing, particularly since this is the FIRST visualization opening the blog post, giving an overview of the various topics to be covered further on. Though I felt the chart conveyed the information accurately, and used a pragmatic color scheme, the redundant and misaligned text detracts greatly from its effectiveness and the reader's ability to quickly understand the message.

The critique method was helpful in really nailing down what elements kept the chart from working well and helped me identify what changes I could make. I realized that the chart is confusing because it gives the impression that there is a x and y axis and that the bars are measures of different things in the same units of measurement. To break up the groups and show that they are not exactly comparable or in the same units, but instead represent different aspects of environmental impact, I initially thought that having different pie charts would work best. However, as I picked apart the different facts presented on the chart, I realized that if I chose to break down the different parts further into their components, the pie would quickly get confusing or overwhelming. 

Creating the wireframes helped me realize that I could convey the same data but way less text and in a less-overwhelming way, though my mocks ups were still not beautiful. The only advantage I could see between using pies vs bars was that the pies seemed to fit in a smaller space, but since space was not a limiting factor in this project, it didn’t hold much weight. Getting a second opinion (testing the solution) was also helpful in confirming that pie charts wouldn’t do any better than bar charts just arranged differently. Getting user feedback also helped me figure out what text I DID need, and how I could reword some things for clarity. It also helped me realized that my chart could use a bit of beautification.
