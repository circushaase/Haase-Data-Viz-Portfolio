For this last vizualization, I felt compelled to stick with a line chart because of the time-series nature of the data. The first grid of line charts makes it easy to access all the different countries at once, but makes it hard to directly compare countries to each other. I experimented with a grid of bar charts by year, but it was difficult to compare trends across the years within the same country. So I finally decided the only way to compare acorss years and countries was to have them all on 1 chart. The chart is definitely overwhelming with all of the countries displayed, hence why I chose to add a filter to let the user pick which countries to compare (and made a note above the chart that picking at least 1 country will help reduce the overload).
