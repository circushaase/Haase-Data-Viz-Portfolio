# Final Project: Part II - Wireframes, Storyboards and User Research

To layout my story, it made the most sense to build a mock-up directly in Shorthand. I followed my story arc sketch as an outline for creating the sections of my story, and even used some of my initial hand-drawn sketches as placeholders, which I will replace with polished, digitally created visualization contructed from actual data.

# User Research
After finishing a draft of the storyboard on Shorthand, I conducted Yser Research and got the following results:

## User 1
- At first glance (before scrolling much), can you tell me what you think this is/about?
Food production in the United States

- (After Scrolling) Can you describe to me what this blog/story is telling you?
The way food is produced in the United States has effects on U.S. residents’ wellbeing: both farmers and the general public. I definitely made me feel like I should be more informed about food production! 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
I thought the farmers markets making a comeback and the link to non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma was interesting. 
The first two visualizations were a bit confusing to me, mostly because I didn’t have context for them. The first one with the two pie charts made me want to know what types of crops are exported in what amounts

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
General public and those interested in becoming farmers or finding better sources for their food

- Is there anything you would change or do differently? (ie: Swap the images to the left of text vs right, in which sections?)
I think the “Affects on Farmers” section was doubled somehow. Maybe also have fewer charts fade in so that you are sure people have time to read them.

-Any other thoughts, suggestions, critiques?
You have a lot of grade data/ideas for visualizations. I would maybe use smaller, more frequent sections of text to contextualize them. 
I really like the arc of your story, especially the way you put the positive changes at the end! That made me more interested in reading about ways I can take action.
I wonder if adding ways to support farm workers would also be another good “take action” item
