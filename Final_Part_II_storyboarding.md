# Final Project: Part II - Wireframes, Storyboards and User Research

To layout my story, it made the most sense to build a mock-up directly in Shorthand. I followed my story arc sketch as an outline for creating the sections of my story, and even used some of my initial hand-drawn sketches as placeholders, which I will replace with polished, digitally created visualization contructed from actual data. I didn't have enough time to write out the text of the story, so I just left the filler text that Shorthand automatically generates.

# User Research
After finishing a draft of the storyboard on Shorthand, I conducted User Research and got the following results:

## User 1
- At first glance (before scrolling much), can you tell me what you think this is/about?:

Food production in the United States

- (After Scrolling) Can you describe to me what this blog/story is telling you?:

The way food is produced in the United States has effects on U.S. residents’ wellbeing: both farmers and the general public. I definitely made me feel like I should be more informed about food production! 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?:

I thought the farmers markets making a comeback and the link to non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma was interesting. 
The first two visualizations were a bit confusing to me, mostly because I didn’t have context for them. The first one with the two pie charts made me want to know what types of crops are exported in what amounts

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?:

General public and those interested in becoming farmers or finding better sources for their food

- Is there anything you would change or do differently? (ie: Swap the images to the left of text vs right, in which sections?):

I think the “Affects on Farmers” section was doubled somehow. Maybe also have fewer charts fade in so that you are sure people have time to read them.

- Any other thoughts, suggestions, critiques?:

You have a lot of grade data/ideas for visualizations. I would maybe use smaller, more frequent sections of text to contextualize them. 
I really like the arc of your story, especially the way you put the positive changes at the end! That made me more interested in reading about ways I can take action.
I wonder if adding ways to support farm workers would also be another good “take action” item

## User 2
- At first glance (before scrolling much), can you tell me what you think this is/about?

Agriculture and food distribution across the county

- (After Scrolling) Can you describe to me what this blog/story is telling you?

Farming and agricultural practices across America, how they are changing and their impacts, and what we can do to balance those back out.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

Global impact chart very small - text hard to read
Transition from CAFOS to Fewer Farms  - fading is weird/ confusing- can’t tell what graph is trying to show, I don’t know what the x and y axes are, because it’s overlaid on the other graph. Make sure nothing is cut. 

Put some text in with the Changes to Farmers because there’s nothing to connect them- Doesn’t have to be as big of a block of text as other sections, but at least a line or two between graphs explaining connections. 

The flow is very good. I don’t know very much about agriculture so all of it was kind of surprising. I figured the jellyfish were just place holders

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

Whoever sees it. 

- Is there anything you would change or do differently? (ie: Swap the images to the left of text vs right, in which sections?)

Hand drawn graphs are cut off and hard to read.

It’s nice that you have the text on the same side the whole way down, it makes it easy to know where to look. Left is fine because we start reading left to right. If the visualizations are the most important then maybe they should all go on the left. If it’s a toss up up, then it doesn’t necessarily matter which size. Maybe it would make more sense to make the text smaller, and only take up maybe 25% rather than 50 % of the space. 

- Any other thoughts, suggestions, critiques?

It looks really nice. You have a good light and dark balance. Keep up the good work!

## User 3
- At first glance (before scrolling much), can you tell me what you think this is/about?

It looks like it’s about industrial scale farming. The title line implies there’s some kind of problem with it and implies a call to action will follow. It’s about the US clearly.

- (After Scrolling) Can 'you describe to me what this blog/story is telling you?

The information in the "Changes to Farms” graphs makes me scared for America, and the simple life of rural America going away. There’s a cultural archetype of an American farmer with a Ford truck and such. People like to think farms are like this, quaint rural things with happy animals and sunshine and such. 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

The title suggests that the story is about the US, but the second and third graphs talk about global statistics. I don’t know if the story is now going to tell me about the world or the US.

I’m not really sure what the title “Mechanization > Productivity” means. I think if you just took “Productivity” out it would make more sense, but I’m not sure if that describes the point that you want to get across.

I thought the “C” in CAFO was for “concentrated”. The graph show the growth, but to get across the point of what a CAFO really is, “number if acres” doesn’t really provide a good picture. You have to talk about how the animals are jam-packed. 

The fading between graphs, plus the floating title “Changes to Farms” is confusing. Do something that utilizes the fact that it’s popping up, like if it was alt-text, or a juicy factoid that makes me more curious. It doesn’t work for a label though, because you see the chart, then you see the label. If “Changes to Farms” Is supposed to describe the first 3 graphs, it should come up before the first one. 

I can’t read the top of some of the graphs, specifically the Lymphoma chart title is cut off. There is a repeated chart also.


- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

Adults, people who can vote

- Is there anything you would change or do differently? (ie: Swap the images to the left of text vs right, in which sections?)

The call to action is very simple and very clear, so it’s a good place to start. It’s definitely trying to hype me up, but I’m not exactly sure what it means. How do I empower myself?

## My Reactions
I knew the user research would be helpful, but it was still somehow way more helpful than expected! Some of the critiques I was able to take action on immediately (typos, accidental repeated charts, images that were cut off, etc.). A lot of it thought were good suggestions for thinkg I was stuck on and couldn't figure out, while others were issues that I hadn't even noticed. I'll definitely be incorporating all the suggestions. It was also really helpful to get critiques from one of my users because they are visaully impaired. At first, I was embarrassed to ask a visually impaired person to help with a visual project, but it was actually the perfect kind of user to ask! This user was able to give me great suggestions. When a visually impaired person tells you to reduce the size of text, it's probably a good idea ;)
